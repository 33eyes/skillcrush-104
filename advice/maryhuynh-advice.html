		<h1>Hi my name is Mary Huynh and I have some advice for you!</h1>
	</header>

			<h3>Prioritize</h3>
				<p>I bet you’ve wanted to learn programming forever but you’ve always put it off. 
				You keep thinking, “Tomorrow or this weekend I’ll definitely start learning,” but life keeps happening to you.</p>

				<p>If you’re really serious about learning to program, treat it like a job. Even if it’s just 10 minutes a day, 
				carve out a set amount of time daily to sit down and learn one new thing about programming.</p>

			<h3>Allow Yourself to Fail (That’s How You Get Good!)</h3>
				<p>Do you think all those web apps came out perfectly the first time? No way! 
				The developers probably went through hundreds of versions before they got to the version you see today.</p>

				<p>There is no “final” perfect version. Failure is part of the learning process. Don’t beat yourself up over it and don’t let it discourage you. 
				Learn from your mistakes and create something even better.</p>
			
			<h3>Help Others</h3>
				<p> I bet you already know to ask a lot of good questions, but once you have all of those awesome coding skills, 
				give back and help others get started on their coding journey.</p>
				
				<p>All of us who have signed up for Skillcrush want more freedom and control over how we work. Skillcrush is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
				
				<p> If we really want to change the way people think about careers, we need to help other like-minded people get hired 
				in the industries we want to work in. We can reject the idea that you have to be X, Y, Z in order to get hired. 
				Instead, we can look at other people and say, “I see the potential in you to be someone great.” and help them figure out 
				what they need to do to become those people. </p>
			
			<h2>Best of luck to all new Skillcrushers! I believe in you!</h2>
