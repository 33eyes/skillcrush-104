			<h4>Errors, errors is what you want!</h4>
			<p>When I started with ruby with Skillcrush, I was in ahurry to learn fast and become a professional developer and always looking ahead to lessons so I can learn and do the exercises without making mistakes. 
			BUT... This is NOT the most effective way to learn! I found myself learning and retaining code much more effectively after I solve errors step by step. 
			When you learn to fix an error, you gain a better understanding of the coding logics.</p>

			<p>Confusion, on the other hand is what I dislike most in this learning process...I don't like feeling lost. But even the, you can google for help.
			It can take time though... Just don't fall into the trap of endless research of certain commands or topics when you're googling. 
			I feel it really takes you off track. Find out what you needed to know, glimpse through some things you find interesting 
			and make a note somewhere so you can come back to it when you come across it again. 
			Learning about something you can use right away is more functional in my opinion.</p>
