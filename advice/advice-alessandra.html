			<h4>Confusion is your friend</h4>
			<p>When I started ruby with Skillcrush, I was in a hurry to learn fast and become a professional developer, thus I was
			always annoyed when I made mistakes or something was not clear to me. 
			BUT... This is NOT an efficient way to learn! I found myself learning
			and retaining code much more effectively after I solve errors step by step and focus on what I have to do in that very moment. 
			When you learn to fix an error, you gain a better understanding of the coding logics and remember things much better.</p>

			<p>Confusion is something I dislike in the learning process...I don't like feeling lost. But even then, you can google for help.
			It can take time though... Just try, even in this case, to stay on what you are working on, don't get into endless research trying to 
			learn everything related to that topic. 
			Find out what you need to know, glimpse through some things you find interesting 
			and make a note somewhere so you can come back to it when you come across it again. 
			It will be easier and more useful</p>
